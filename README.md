## Usage

### Redeploy

From legacy-heroku branch (`git checkout legacy-heroku`)

```bash
git push heroku legacy-heroku:master
```

## Backup/Restore

Now that our backend is S3, we can backup and restore with `aws s3 {cp|sync}`

```bash
# checksum
aws --profile im-dan s3 cp s3://im-weight/observationdata.json - | md5sum
curl -s https://im-weight.herokuapp.com/backup | md5sum
cat observationdata.json | md5sum
cat backup/observationdata.json | md5sum

# head (latest)
aws --profile im-dan s3 cp s3://im-weight/observationdata.json - | jq .values[0]
curl -s https://im-weight.herokuapp.com/backup | jq .values[0]
cat backup/observationdata.json | jq .values[0]

# backup
aws --profile im-dan s3 cp s3://im-weight/observationdata.json observationdata.json
# restore
aws --profile im-dan s3 cp observationdata.json s3://im-weight/observationdata.json
```

## Historical Below

## Temporary backups

These have been replaced to point to heroku
[Backups from appfog](http://im-weight.aws.af.cm/)
We are making hourly backups in dirac:~/Sites/im-weight/observationdata.json

Note: dnode-shoe-socks has been merged and deployed.

## Deploy to appfog

Seems we need to tell appfog to use node 0.10.x, and use `npm-shrinkwrap.json` which is git-ignored

```bash
  npm shrinkwrap
  af --runtime=node10 update im-weight
```

## Plan (2014-09-20)

We started to move to the new dnode in Jul 2013, but left it unmerged, this is what I'd like to accomplish:

- Deploy a new fronted (separate repo)
  - to simplify will add simple POST to addObs
  - if I can get shoe/socks/dnode to work in the new frontend, we can keep this backend, otherwise move to firebase/meteor
- AngularJS fronted (CORS) - [angular-dygraphs](http://cdjackson.github.io/angular-dygraphs/)
- Eventually Separate the backend, do we keep socks ?

## TODO - Old

- If we are keeping this backend, fix npm outdated: express 4.x,...
- Move to firebase/meteor/angular
- remove cloudfoundry package (npm)
- mv backup script to repo.. on darwin, and dirac

## Moved to appfog : 2013-06-29

When it's up, you can find it [here on appfog](http://im-weight.aws.af.cm/)
Install appfog tools

```bash
gem install af
af login
af update im-weight --runtime=node08
```

## im-weight Mongo backed metric tracker (weight)

When it's up, you can find it [here on cloudfoundry](http://im-w.cloudfoundry.com)
Started from example at
[cloudfoundry_node_mongodb](https://github.com/gatesvp/cloudfoundry_node_mongodb.git)

```bash
# get dependencies
npm install

# if not yet created...
vmc push im-w

# to push an update
vmc update im-w
```

## Charting

[Dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com/): Google type charting, and add touchmove capability

## icons

[Retina Icons](http://www.iconfinder.com/search/1/?q=iconset%3Atwg_retina_icons)

## Seeding initial data

No longer needed, `plist` has been removed from package.json dependencies.

Could use [xml2json](https://github.com/buglabs/node-xml2json), but try [plist](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-plist) which uses sax npm module.

```bash
# convert observationdata.xml to observationdata.json
node convert.js

# git diff to confirm, git commit to backup!
```

## Icons old
